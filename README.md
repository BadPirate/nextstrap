# NextJS + Bootstrap

Found that I was always adding bootstrap to my projects, and so made a repo to pull to make a clean start

## Installation

1. `git clone https://github.com/BadPirate/nextstrap.git MyProjectName`
2. `cd MyProjectName; git remote rm origin`
3. `npm run dev`
4. Carry on my wayward son.
